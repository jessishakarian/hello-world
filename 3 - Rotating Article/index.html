            <h1>Why Chopper Is the Best Droid in the Galaxy</h1>
            <small>Jessica Shakarian</small>
            <p>Within the Star Wars galaxy, droids are an essential part of the universe - they assist with everything from medical operations, systems management on cruisers, piloting and maintanence on starships, and anything in between. We all know and love R2D2 and C3P0, our first introduction to the variations in droids. But there is one droid who I would argue is the best droid in the galaxy - C1-10P, aka Chopper. Chopper is a C1 unit, who worked on Y-wing planes during the Clone Wars. He looks very different than R2, who has a domed cap. He has arms, and a squared cap. Where R2 is sassy and talkative because he hasnâ€™t had his memory wiped, Chop takes that to another level.</p>
            <h3>C1-10P (Chopper)</h3>

            <p>Chopper has sass but to a point where he seems more like a jerk sometimes, I know a lot of people find his attitude to be a bit brusque. But really Chopper just enjoys the attention for doing the right thing. So he does come around to it, and credit where credit is due. He will give you an earful while he does the right thing though, but I think his sense of humor is great. Say what you want about Chopper, but he is efficient at taking out imperials. He has what might be the highest kill count of any droid in the universe.</p>
